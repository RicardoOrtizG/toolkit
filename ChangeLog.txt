List of changes to the migrator template, in reverse chronological order of implementation:

2014-09-20 Added queries "0 verbatimDepth with Unit", "1 Parsed minmaxDepth", "2 Parsed minmaxDepth", "Update LegacyData with parsed minmaxDepth" and improved the similar query for verbatimElevation processing - "0 verbatimElevation with Unit". Added verbatimDepth field to LegacyData table to support this.
2014-09-19 Added queries "Update out of range year to null", "Update out of range month to null", "Update out of range day to null".
2014-09-19 Added check for leap year not in centuries except those evenly divisible by 400 in query "Update DayOfYear".
2014-09-16 Added processing to replace more symbols in queries "01 - Legacy latitude replace characters" and "01 - Legacy longitude replace characters".
2014-09-16 Corrected processing of signs in queries "02 - Legacy longitude decimal degrees sans hemisphere" and "13 - LegacyData decimal latlong".
2014-09-16 Corrected error that referenced verbatimLatitude instead of verbatimLongitude in query "01 - Legacy longitude replace characters".
2014-09-16 Copied the structure of LegacyData from TTU Mammals migrator so that the step-wise processing implemented on 2014-06-11 can function correctly with the template and migrators derived from it.
2014-09-11 Added query "Update eventDate for yyyy-mm-dd" to correct eventDates with single digit month and day. This happens systematically with collections exported from Specify.
2014-09-01 Updated queries "Update infraspecificEpithet for SSP" and "Update specificEpithet for SP".
2014-07-24 Added query "Report - missing catalogNumber".
2014-07-16 Added query "Update higherGeography for all Nulls".
2014-06-11 Added step-wise processing for verbatim coordinates based on diversity in TTU Mammals data. Should be more readily reusable in other contexts than what the migrator had before. Removed previous LegacyData verbatim coordinate processing (
"Update LegacyData with LatLong from verbatimCoordinates", 
"Update LegacyData for missing Dirs", 
"Update LegacyData with DecimalDegrees", 
"Update LegacyData with DMS", 
"Update LegacyData with MaxErrorDistance",
"Update LegacyData with parsed decLatLong").
2014-06-11 Changed query "Update CoordinateUncertaintyInMeters from LegacyData" to convert coordinateUncertaintyInMeters to a long integer.
2014-05-21 Added reports for Year, Month, and Day out of range.
2014-05-21 Changed typo in field verbatimCoordinnates to verbatimCoordinates in LegacyData tables.
2014-04-14 In the query "SimpleDwC-verbatim from Specimens", added a check for preparator=collector, and used only one copy in recordedBy if so.
2014-02-03 Added query to turn coordinateUncertaintyInMeters to null if "0".
2013-12-21 Made amendments to various queries so that they are more generic and less likely to require adjustment when used as a template for new collections. Includes "Append Source Data to Specimens", "Prepend verbatim geography to verbatimLocality", "SimpleDwC-verbatim from Specimens", and "Update higherClassification with verbatim taxonomy".
2013-12-20 Added queries "Update species subspecies to null for null genus" and "Update subspecies to null for null species" so that records without higher ranks do not have lower rank epithets.
2013-12-10 Amended and separated checks for non-numeric decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude in queries "Update DecLatLong for non-numeric1" AND "Update DecLatLong for non-numeric2".
2013-12-10 Added reports for fossils to the "Do DwC2 Migration" macro.
2013-09-24 Added reports for StatsDifferences and StatsCompleteness and included these in the generated reports.
2013-09-02 Amended query name for "Update NomenclaturalStatus" to "Update NomenclaturalCode", which is what it actually does.
2013-08-27 Moved the encumbering part of the "Do DwC2 Migration" macro to just before copying SimpleDwC-verbatim into SimpleDwC. Otherwise the encumbrances would not occur.
2013-07-28 Separated the DiGIR processing into its own template and script to avoid running it if not necessary.
2013-07-28 Changed PurgeNonprintingCharacters.sh to replace last carriage return/line feed combination in the file with сс so that split files will concatenate without joining to the first line of the next file.
2013-07-17 Added GitHub repository at https://github.com/VertNet/toolkit to manage code.
2013-07-12 Changed PurgeNonprintingCharacters.sh to use сс instead of || as search and replace pattern because content with || was found in provider data (Macaulay Library).
2013-07-12 Added notHigherGeography field to LookupGeography in VertNetVocabularies.mdb, to capture information in higher geography that should be moved to locality. Added report to show records where changes can be suggested.
2013-07-12 Added error field to the indeterminate geography report and began managing that field in VertNetVocabularies.mdb.
2013-07-03 Amended Aggregator database for Append Queries (Fish, Fossil, Herp, and Mammal) that mapped verbatimCoordinates to verbatimCoordinateSystem.
2013-07-03 Added GeorefVerificationStatus vocabulary management.
2013-06-10 Added Purge processing for Dublic Core types Sound, StillImage, and MovingImage to PurgeNonprintingCharacters.sh and NewLineIssues.awk.
2013-03-04 Corrected faulty logic in "Update DecLatLong for range" and "Update DecLatLong for non-numeric" queries.
2013-05-03 Change strategy for verbatim classification. Store this in higherClassification with all ranks given in the source from genus up. Do not write over it with standardized values.
2013-05-02 Added a duplicate catalogNumber report to the outputs.
2013-05-01 Slightly rearranged and demarcated processing macro to distinguish production of SimpleDwC-verbatim, LegacyData, and SimpleDwC. Better demonstrates where data cleaning could be done outside the migrator.
2013-05-01 Added some verbatimLatitude and Longitude processing queries used in CM migrator to produce decimalLatitude and Longitude.
2013-04-18 Nonprinting character report (in RunAggregators script) added to outputs in reports folder.
2013-04-17 Added more paths in scripts to find MSACCESS.EXE so that scripts will run on a larger number of default configurations.
2013-04-17 Added the capability to split the file ForIPT\SimpleDwCForVertNetPrePurge.csv into smaller files for purge processing to avoid out of memory errors.
2013-04-15 Corrected the Prepend Geography to verbatimLocality query to be an update query.
2013-04-15 Added LookupReproductiveCondition table to local vocabularies processing and MySQL, including Stats. Relinked to StatsCompleteness table.
2013-03-15 Created reports folder and changed report file export destinations to it.
2013-03-15 Amended reports to compare verbatim original genus, family, order to standard versions - was comparing published versus standard.
2013-03-15 Start adding non-DwC standard taxonomy rank information to dynamicProperties.
